## 🎯 What Are Outside Bets?

In roulette, every possible wager falls into one of two categories:

- **Inside bets**: Specific numbers or small combinations.  
  - 🎰 High payouts, **low odds**
- **Outside bets**: Larger sections of the wheel.  
  - 🧩 Lower payouts, **better chances of success**

### 🟠 Common Outside Bets

- **Red/Black** (Even money)
- **Odd/Even** (Even money)
- **High/Low** (1–18 or 19–36, even money)
- **Dozens** (1st 12, 2nd 12, 3rd 12 – pays 2:1)
- **Columns** (Vertical columns of 12 numbers – pays 2:1)

Even-money bets may not promise massive wins, but they deliver **frequent outcomes**. Column and dozen bets involve slightly more risk and variance, but still offer a smoother ride compared to high-volatility inside bets.

For players looking to **extend their gameplay** or **reduce sudden swings** in balance, even-money bets provide a more predictable experience.
